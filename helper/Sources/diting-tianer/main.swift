    //   1. The TCC subject seen by macOS is the helper bundle (not
    //      the terminal that launched us). Inherited responsibility
    //      from Terminal → diting → diting-tianer breaks this on
    //      macOS 26 — tccd attributes the request to Terminal,
    //      which has no NSLocationUsageDescription, and CWNetwork
    //      redacts ssid / bssid silently. Fix: disclaim our parent
    //      so we become our own responsible process. Same hop the
    //      ble-scan subcommand has done since v0.5.0.
    //
    //   2. The process is a *registered* CoreLocation consumer at
    //      the moment scanForNetworks runs — meaning a
    //      CLLocationManager exists AND its delegate has received
    //      `didChangeAuthorization` from locationd. The earlier
    //      v1.0.3 / v1.0.6 attempts used `Thread.sleep` then
    //      `RunLoop.run(mode:before:)` — neither reliably pumps the
    //      libdispatch main queue the delegate callback rides on
    //      inside a short-lived CLI subprocess. The fix is to drive
    //      everything from inside `dispatchMain()` — same pattern
    //      as the bluetooth-status probe — so libdispatch's main
    //      queue is fully active during the auth handshake AND the
    //      scan call.
    //
    //   3. The CLLocationManager reference stays alive across the
    //      scanForNetworks call. The global g_scanWorker pins it
    //      for the lifetime of the process.
    //
    // The earlier code comment claiming CoreLocation was "more
    // lenient" than CoreBluetooth was wrong; CoreWLAN on macOS 26
    // enforces all three. v1.0.6 implemented (1) and partially (2)
    // but the run-loop pump it used didn't actually drive the
    // libdispatch handshake — scans only appeared to work when a
    // GUI bundle had recently run and warmed the system caches.
    // This v1.0.7 implementation uses dispatchMain() so registration
    // completes reliably from cold.
    // Two code paths share this function:
    //
    //   A. CLI subprocess from Python (no DITING_SCAN_VIA_LAUNCH env):
    //      Re-launch ourselves via `open` so the new instance is
    //      bona fide LaunchServices-attributed, then read its result
    //      file. On macOS 26 this is the only way to get a CLI scan
    //      that sees the bundle's Location grant — direct-exec
    //      binaries (even when in the bundle's Contents/MacOS/) are
    //      not attributed to the bundle and CLLocationManager.
    //      authorizationStatus stays at .notDetermined no matter
    //      what NSApp / dispatchMain / disclaim trick we try.
    //      Empirically verified 2026-05-13.

// macOS attaches every spawned process a "responsible" pid for TCC

// Warp, iTerm2, Terminal). When diting's Python TUI invokes us as
// `<bundle>/Contents/MacOS/diting-tianer ble-scan` from inside such
// a terminal, the responsible process is the terminal app, *not* this
// helper. CoreBluetooth's TCC check then looks up
// NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription in the responsible app's
// Info.plist — which never declares it — and SIGABRTs us with a
// privacy-violation crash.
//
// The fix is to disclaim our inherited responsibility before doing
// any TCC-protected work, so the kernel records *us* as our own
// responsible process. This is done by posix_spawn'ing ourselves once
// with a private spawn-attribute (`responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim`)
// and exiting in the original process. The re-spawned child sees its
// own bundle Info.plist (now embedded into __TEXT,__info_plist as well
// as Contents/Info.plist), TCC accepts the usage description, and the
// scan proceeds normally. The disclaim env-var stops infinite recursion.
//
// CoreLocation's TCC check is more lenient than CoreBluetooth's — it
// resolves usage descriptions via Bundle.main with a fallback path —
// which is why the existing `scan` (Wi-Fi) subcommand works without
// disclaim. Only the BLE path needs this hop.

// watchdog (_watchdog.py) shells out to this rather than emitting via
// osascript.
//
// Same outer / inner LaunchServices split as `scan`. The reason is the
// same macOS 26 TCC asymmetry: direct-exec subprocesses of an ad-hoc-
// signed bundle's binary do NOT inherit the bundle's TCC grants. For
// Notifications that means `requestAuthorization` reports `granted=false`
// even when the user clicked Allow during the install-time HelperAppDelegate
// flow. The fix mirrors `runScanAndDumpJSON`:
//
//   A. Outer (no DITING_NOTIFY_VIA_LAUNCH env): spawn ourselves via
//      `/usr/bin/open -W -g -a <bundle>` so the inner instance is
//      LaunchServices-attributed and sees the bundle's Notifications
//      grant. Title + body travel via env vars (newline / quote safe).
//   B. Inner (DITING_NOTIFY_VIA_LAUNCH=1): set activation policy to
//      `.prohibited` (defence-in-depth alongside LSUIElement=true so
//      nothing can ever flash even on older macOS), call
//      UNUserNotificationCenter, exit.
//
// We wait briefly before exit() in the inner half so the notification
// request actually makes it through the system daemon — a process
// that exits too fast can lose the message. 1 s is enough in practice.

          notify --title T --body B
