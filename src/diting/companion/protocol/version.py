The version is a single integer major. The rule mirrors the macOS-helper
schema rule: a newer producer adds fields additively within a major and
never changes the meaning of an existing field, so a consumer that knows
major N tolerates any payload stamped N. A payload stamped with an
unknown (newer) major is refused — abstained on — rather than processed.
